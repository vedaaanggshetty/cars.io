              <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a roadster (a two-seat car without a fixed roof),[26] however there are also several examples of early sports cars with four seats.[4]

                Sports cars are not usually intended to regularly transport more than two adult occupants, so most modern sports cars are usually two-seat layout or 2+2 layout (two smaller rear seats for children or occasional adult use). Larger cars with more spacious rear-seat accommodation are usually considered sports sedans rather than sports cars.
                
                The 1993-1998 McLaren F1 is notable for using a three-seat layout, where the front row consists of a centrally-located driver's seat.</p>
