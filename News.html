              <p style="text-decoration: underline;">“The Nevera is astonishingly fast. Fast in a way that’s tricky to put into words, either while you’re sitting in it trying to process what the hell is happening to your mind, body and soul when you nail the throttle, or a few days later writing about it,” wrote Jason Barlow when he got the call to test drive the Rimac Nevera in Croatia last year. So allow us to hit you with some numbers instead: courtesy of a 120kWh battery, four motors driving each wheel individually, and a power output equivalent to 1,914bhp and 1,740lb ft of torque, Mate Rimac’s hypercar is capable of 0-60mph in 1.85 seconds, 100mph in 4.3secs, and 186mph in 9.3secs – on to a 258mph max. Ah dammit, we’re even more lost for words…</p>
